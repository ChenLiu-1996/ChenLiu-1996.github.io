<p style="font-size: 24px">
Open to research internship (Summer 2025). Please let me know if you have opportunities in spatial-temporal modeling, manifold learning, multimodal learning, AI in healthcare, or related fields.

<p style="font-size: 16px">
I am currently a 3rd-year PhD candidate at Yale University. My research explores both theory and application of machine learning. On the theory side, I focus on helping neural networks learn better representations in the latent space, and one of my most recent work focus on modeling spatial-temporal dynamics in irregularly-sampled image series. On the application side, I extend my research to medical imaging and other biomedical data.

<!-- Prior to pursuing my PhD, I graduated from Columbia University in 2019 with a master degree in Electrical Engineering. In my first industry job, I worked at a startup company named Matic on computer vision and SLAM. Then I worked as a senior research scientist at GE Healthcare, on deep learning in medical imaging applications. -->
