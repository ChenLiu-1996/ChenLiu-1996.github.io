# A Technical Deep Dive into Drag Your GAN (DragGAN)

### Overview
This is a casual explanation of our paper that introduced the concept of Diffusion Spectral Entropy (DSE) and Diffusion Spectral Mutual Information (DSMI).

### Citation
You are very welcome to cite the following papers (the "DSE2024" version preferred) instead if you find this blog helpful.

These are different versions of the same work. "DSE2024" is the final published version at an IEEE information
theory conference. "DSE2024_arxiv" is the preprint version with the most amount of details. "DSE2023" is an ICML workshop version.
